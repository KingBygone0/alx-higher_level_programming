## About
- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [ALX SE](https:/alxafrica.com/).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

## Python Program Compilation

The compilation process has four different steps:
1. Parsing stage
2. Compilation to Bytecode
3. Execution
4. Runtime Optimization
    
### Step 1: Parsing ``
The Python interpreter reads your Python source code and parses it to create a syntax tree, 
which is a hierarchical representation of your code's structure. During this phase, 
Python checks for syntax errors and ensures that your code follows the rules of the Python language.
    
### Step 2: Compilation to Bytecode `-pyc`
After parsing, the Python code is compiled into bytecode. 
Bytecode is a low-level representation of your Python code that is easier and faster for the Python interpreter to execute. 
Python stores this bytecode in .pyc files (compiled Python files) for reuse in subsequent runs, which can speed up the execution of your code.

### Step 3: Execution
The Python interpreter executes the bytecode. 
It reads the bytecode instructions one by one and performs the corresponding operations. 
This is the step where your Python program's logic is executed.

### Step 4: Runtime Optimization
Python has a runtime optimizer known as the "Python optimizer" that can make further optimizations while the code is running. This includes things like function inlining and other performance improvements. These optimizations are not always significant, but they can enhance the performance of certain Python code.

So, while Python does have a compilation step, it's not the same as the traditional compilation process in languages like C or C++. Python code is not compiled to machine code that can be run independently; instead, it's compiled to bytecode, which is executed by the Python interpreter at runtime. This is one of the reasons Python is often referred to as an interpreted language.
